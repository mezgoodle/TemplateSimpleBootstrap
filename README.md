# Homework
One day, my friend asked me to help create a site. I said I'd make it in **5 minutes**. As for me, there is no better CSS-library than [Boostrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap), so I chose it. A small site came out. You can see it [here](https://mezgoodle.github.io/TemplateSimpleBootstrap/).
